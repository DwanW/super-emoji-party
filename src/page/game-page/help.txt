player attribute information:

health/positivity: 0 health skip turn, more health decrease chance unfavorable encounter
spirit: low spirit reduce max roll to 1, more spirit increase roll range( eg: low spirit roll: 1~3, high spirit roll: 1~7)
inventory: each player has three inventory slots, each can hold a unique item:
    item type:
        1. increase resistance against health reduction;
        2. increase resistance against spirit reduction;
        3. increase max health;
        4. increase mas spirit;
        5. health recovery bonus each turn;
        6. spirit recovery bonus each turn;
        7. increase base max roll;
        8. increase base min roll;

choice consequence type:
    0. change health/spirit; (modifying stats)
    1. move back/forward a certain amount; (modifying position)
    2. relocate (modifying position)
    3. add/remove/replace item into inventory;
    4. mini(quiz/game)

rolldie value calculation:
 1 ~ (1-7)
    roll = Math.floor(8/(1+Math.pow(Math.E,0.027425*(50-spirit))));(sigmoidal - logistic function)

base positive encounter chance = 0.7;
base negative encounter chance = 0.3;

positive encounter chance range = 0.5(-20%) to 0.9 (+20%);
negative encounter chance = 0.1 (-20%) to 0.5 (+20%);

 above >=30   bonus chance = 0.1693 ln( health + 1) - 0.5814 (logrithmic)
 below 30   bonus chance = 0.006777 health - 0.2    (linear)
